## Reasoning Behind Decisions:
To implement the blockchain, the program uses the `Block` class, and to implement the chain, it uses a list of blocks simulating a linked list.

## Time Efficiency:
The functions `calc_hash`, `add_block`, and `create_genesis_block` have a time complexity of **O(1)** because they only perform a constant number of operations.

## Space Efficiency:
Similarly, the functions `calc_hash`, `add_block`, and `create_genesis_block` have a space complexity of **O(1)** because they only use a constant amount of memory.
